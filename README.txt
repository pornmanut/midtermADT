Exmaple Coding for MidtermADT

-> stack-in-C.c : Sample for using stack only in main
-> sampleQueue-in-C.c : Sample of Queue that use typedef to make mutil-Queue
-> 2018-ex9.c : Example wMxRyLz using stack
-> hanoi.c : Example recursive hanoi only text show
-> 2552-Ex11.c Example recursive that use ++ only and -- only to make a+b
-> 2552-Ex12.c Example recursive that use ++ -- only and a+b to make a*b
-> 2552-Ex14.c Exmaple that use muti-Stack[queue] to make function that can remove 2nd
	       from bottom of stack and can relocation of data using queue


Good luck;
